      "source": "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n\n### 1. Encapsulation: \nThis concept involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps maintain the integrity of the data.\n\n### 2. Abstraction: \nAbstraction allows developers to simplify complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of an object, while hiding the unnecessary details. This helps to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n\n### 3. Inheritance: \nInheritance enables a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n\n### 4. Polymorphism: \nPolymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon, typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.\n\n### 5. Composition: \nComposition involves building complex types by combining objects (or other classes). It promotes a \"has-a\" relationship rather than an \"is-a\" relationship, allowing for more flexible and modular design.\n\nThese concepts work together to create a robust framework for designing and organizing code in a way that promotes maintainability and scalability.",
